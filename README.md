# TwitterScraperBot
Using twit to scrape for specific parameters then using Sequelize to log it to an SQL database.
My goal is to implement a front end eventuly to alow easy utilization of my data configuration, and to allow for a simple
access to "TwitterScrapeBot" controls. 
Inorder to use you will need to get your own twitter API key the proccess is easy it just requires your twitter information. 
I would highly recomend not using your personal twitter account when messing with bots.

Your API key will need to be pasted into "var apiKey = '' " in the file named API info
This is one of my first readme's that i have implemented into my file so bare with me if it isnt very helpful.
